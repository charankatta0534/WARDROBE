    <!--<string name="kids_boys_wear">Kids clothing is often more casual than adult clothing, fit for play and rest. Hosiery is commonly used. More recently, however, a lot of childrenswear is heavily influenced by trends in adult fashion. Due to the rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, celebrities and fashion bloggers have been using their accounts to post pictures of their children wearing luxury "street style" clothing, thus inspiring parents to dress their children as they would dress themselves. Good quality, well designed, garments are now a priority for a growing number of parents and children's clothing is getting a prime place in top label stores and high-end fashion retail outlets.

    <!--<string name="kids_summer_wear">Cotton absorbs the sweat from your body and allows it to evaporate into the air. It works like a towel, wicking the moisture away from your skin and discouraging the growth of bacteria and yeast. This makes it the perfect fabric for summer, because it keeps you cool and prevents infections. You should avoid synthetic fabrics as much as possible, because unlike cotton and other natural fabrics, most synthetic fabrics do not breathe. So when you sweat, the sweat doesnt dry off like it should.</string>-->

    <!--<string name="mens_traditional_wear">Traditional dress may be defined as the ensemble of garments, jewelry, and accessories rooted in the past that is worn by an identifiable group of people. Though slight changes over time in color, form, and material are acknowledged, the assemblage seems to be handed down unchanged from the past. Traditional dress or costume is a phrase used widely both by the general public and writers on dress. It conjures up images of rural people dressed in colorful, layered, exotic clothing from an idealized past in some faraway place. This notion of traditional dress has been scrutinized and found inadequate by many researchers and scholars, but its uncritical use continues into the twenty-first century. The phrase traditional dress or costume is often used interchangeably with the terms ethnic, regional, and folk dress.
